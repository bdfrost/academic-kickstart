Certified Google Cloud Architect and Amazon Solutions Architect providing quality technical leadership and development of fast, efficient, and highly-available systems and operations. Excellent communicator who values the contributions of others and the merit that they bring.

I have been active in technology for more than 20 years and have learned that leadership isn't what I initially thought. It isn't making demands rather it is as Ken Kesey once said, "You donâ€™t lead by pointing and telling people some place to go. You lead by going to that place and making a case." 

As a technology leader I am constantly learning how best to empower others while staying active in the latest trends in technology.
